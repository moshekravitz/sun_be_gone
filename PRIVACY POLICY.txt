include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your
privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored

implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we
must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
this privacy notice.
